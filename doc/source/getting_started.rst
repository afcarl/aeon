Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

First, if you haven't already, install neon_. Then grab aeon's dependencies:

Ubuntu::

  sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev clang libopencv-dev

OSX::

  brew tap homebrew/science
  brew install opencv
  
CentOS/Fedora::

  sudo dnf install opencv-devel clang

Then install aeon under your neon virtualenv::

  git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon.git
  cd aeon
  python setup.py install

If your neon is installed system wide, you can instead install aeon system wide 
as well using `sudo python setup.py install`.

Now continue on to the :doc:`user_guide` to get started using aeon. Or to the 
:doc:`developer_guide` to developing custom loaders/transformers.
